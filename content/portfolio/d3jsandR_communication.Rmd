Hello,

In this post we will focus ourself on how to integrate a message from R to javascript. More precisely, we will focus on the basic key words and knowledge to integrate a d3.js graphic into shiny, just like [here](http://51.254.215.145:3838/shiny-fret/).
If you have any issue to make shiny and javascript communicate after reading this post, I suggest you to go back to this simple [shiny app](  http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/server-to-client-custom-messages.html)  from Rstudio.<br><br>
First of all, you will create a folder where you will put your data file (.csv, .txt, etc..) and your app.R (or ui.R and server.R). In this folder,  you will create a new folder that you will name "www". You will put your .css and .js file inside "www". <br><br>
<img src="img/folder_www.png" style = "max-width:100%;"> <br><br>

To make R and d3.js communicate, you will have to put some key words in the server part, the ui part and the .js file.<br><br>
**in server.R**, put your data that you want to send to javascript in an **observe({ })** function. Just like bellow:
```
function(input, output, session) {
    observe({
        dataSendToJs = "Hello World"
        session$sendCustomMessage(type = 'nameOfTheMessage',dataSendToJs)
    })
}
```
**session$sendCustomMessage( )** allows you to send your data from shiny to javascript. <br><br>

**in ui.R**, source the javascript document via a tag function. 
```
fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Example"),
  fluidRow(
  #Shiny way to integrate html code in the web page
  tags$head(tags$script(src = "message.js"))
  )
)
```
<br>
**in .js**, code has to begin with **"Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler("nameOfTheMessage", function(message) {"** like the following example. Don't forget message represents data from R that javascript will read so it's better to transform them to json data. You can do it in R via the function `jsonlite::toJSON()`.
```
Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler("nameOfTheMessage",
                                      function(message) {
                                              alert(JSON.stringify(message));
                                      });
```

Now it should work! You can find the whole process in this repository. We have begin with something simple but you can do more complex thing with same logic.

Be carefull, if you're working locally, you have to make some modification:
First, you need to have a webserver. I use [web server for chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en). If you choose to use the same web server, it's very simple. <br>
First, in "CHOOSE FOLDER", ou have to choose the "www" folder that you have made previously, then a  web server url will appear. Click on it, then a new web page with the different files from "www" should pop-up.<br><br>
<img src="img/webserver_source.png" style = "max-width:100%;"> <br><br>
In ui.R (or the ui part of your single-file shiny app), source d3.min.js and all ".css" and ".js" files as follow:
```
#http://127.0.0.1:8887 represents the web server URL
tags$head(tags$script(src = "http://127.0.0.1:8887/d3.min.js"))
```
Now it should work :)
