## Bruno Rodrigues
![Bruno Rodrigues][1]

Research assistant at [STATEC](http://www.statistiques.public.lu/en/index.html) interested in 
econometrics, machine learning and numerical methods in general.

I'm a huge fan of the R programming language and its awesome community. My way of giving 
back to this awesome community is to share my knowledge!

I also have another blog, which is more focused on econometrics with R and general R programming
tips over [here](http://www.brodrigues.co).
