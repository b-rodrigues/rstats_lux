<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In this post I will explain how to launch a shiny application from a shortcut. just like that: <video controls="" height="400" width="640"> <source src="/img/portfolio/launch_icon.mp4" type="video/mp4"/> </video></p>
<p>It’s short and usefull if you work with colleagues that don’t know a clue about R and just want to use your shiny app. <del>I suggest you to follow this guide. Your colleagues will double click on the shortcut and directly be in front of their application.</del></p>
<h4>
If you are on MAC:
</h4>
<p>Open a text editor and write the following lines :</p>
<pre><code> Rscript &#39;&amp;FullPath/&amp;file.R&#39; &amp;
 open http://127.0.0.1:&amp;PortNumber/;</code></pre>
<p><strong>&amp;</strong> allows you to write more command lines even if the shell is still busy with the previous line. The second line open your web browser with the chosen address. A concrete example gives that: <img src="img/portfolio/launch_code.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>On the second line, <strong>7990</strong> refers to the choosen port in your shiny app. If you haven’t choosen one, go back to the file where you have wrote the application and add to shinyApp: <strong>options = list(port= 7990)</strong>, just like that:<br> <strong>shinyApp(ui=ui,server=server, options = list(port=7990))</strong><br></p>
<p>if you use a <strong>.Rmd</strong> document, you should write this:</p>
<pre><code> Rscript -e  &quot;rmarkdown::run(&#39;&amp;FullPath/&amp;file.Rmd&#39;, shiny_args = list(port=&amp;PortNumber))&quot; &amp;
 open http://127.0.0.1:&amp;PortNumber/&amp;file.Rmd;</code></pre>
<p>Replace &amp;FullPath, &amp;file and &amp;PortNumber by the file path, the file name and the chosen port. <br> <br> Then save it with the <strong>“.command”</strong> extension and try to launch your shiny application from the shortcut. if you have a message saying that the file could not be executed because you do not have appropriate access privileges, open your terminal and write the following line:</p>
<pre><code>chmod u+x &amp;FullPath/&amp;file.command</code></pre>
Then it should work :) <br> We are almost done, now we have to add another shortcut icon to make it look more <del>user</del> friendly. For that, go on google and download free <strong>.icns</strong> icons. I have download some icons on <a href="http://www.easyicon.net/">easyicon</a>. To change the icon you just need to go in “get info” and drag your new icon to the previous one, just like bellow:<br> <video controls="" height="400" width="640"> <source src="/Users/user/Desktop/Clef_USB/data_science/hugo/static/img/portfolio/change_icon.mp4" type="video/mp4" /> </video> <br><br>
<h4>
If you are on Windows:
</h4>
<p>Open a text editor and write the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>start &quot;&quot; &quot;&amp;FullPath1\Rscript.exe&quot; &amp;FullPath2\&amp;file.R  /k
start &quot;Name&quot; &quot;http://127.0.0.1:&amp;PortNumber/&quot;</code></pre>
<p><strong>/k</strong> allows you to write something in the command prompt even if the Prompt is busy with the previous line. A concrete example gives that : <img src="/Users/user/Desktop/Clef_USB/data_science/hugo/static/img/portfolio/mlaunch_code.png"  /></p>
<p>Then you can save your file with a <strong>.bat</strong> extension. <br> Be carefull, if you want to launch a <strong>.Rmd</strong> you should use this code instead :</p>
<pre><code>start &quot;&amp;FullPath1\R.exe&quot; -e &quot;Sys.setenv(RSTUDIO_PANDOC=&#39;C:/Program Files/RStudio/bin/pandoc&#39;); rmarkdown::run(&#39;&amp;FullPath2/&amp;file.Rmd&#39;, shiny_args = list(port =&amp;PortNumber, launch.browser = FALSE))&quot; /k
start &quot;&amp;file&quot; &quot;http://127.0.0.1:7924/&amp;file.Rmd&quot;</code></pre>
<p>if it doesn’t work, check your pandoc location.</p>
<p>It’s almost done. Now we have to change the icon. first you have to download an icon with the .ico extension. then you have to act in 4 steps : </br> 1. Right click on your file and go in <strong>Properties</strong>. </br> 2. Choose the <strong>Shortcut</strong> tab. </br> 3. Then go in <strong>Change Icon…</strong>. </br> 4. In Browse, select the icon you want to see instead. </br> <img src="/Users/user/Desktop/Clef_USB/data_science/hugo/static/img/portfolio/micon_change.png" style = "max-width:640px;"></p>
<p>And now it’s done! <br><br><br> Don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any comments or suggestions.</p>
