      <description>Hello everyone,
In this post we will focus on how to send a message from R to javascript. More precisely, we will focus on the basic keywords and knowledge to integrate a d3.js graph into shiny, just like here. If you have any issue to make shiny and javascript communicate after reading this post, I suggest you to go back to this simple shiny app from Rstudio.
First of all, create a folder where you will put your data file (.</description>

      <description>A lot of open data is available in Luxembourgâ€™s open data portal, but sometimes, it is not very easy to download. In the video below, I give you an example of such data and show how you can use rvest to get the data easily.
After watching the video, take a look at the code below. This code does two things; first it scrapes the data, and then it puts the data in a tidy format fur further processing.</description>

      <description>Bruno Rodrigues Research assistant at STATEC interested in econometrics, machine learning and numerical methods in general.
I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of the R programming language and its awesome community. My way of giving back to this awesome community is to share my knowledge!
I also have another blog, which is more focused on econometrics with R and general R programming tips over here.
